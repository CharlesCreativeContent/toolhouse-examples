Toolhouse is a platform that helps developers integrate tools in their projects, to build powerful AI agents. 
You can start this journey with only 3 lines of code.

In this repo we'll explore some examples of different ways you can leverage our pre-built tools and create applications that can perform many useful tasks. This project also demonstrates how to build an API that integrates Toolhouse SDK and OpenAI's GPT models to create various use cases. It provides endpoints for customer service, blog writing, pet care, and more.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharlesCreativeContent/toolhouse-example.git
cd toolhouse-example
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Toolhouse and OpenAI API keys:
```bash
TOOLHOUSE_API_KEY=your_toolhouse_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Make sure to install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt4
```

## Step 4: Run the Application
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the server with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will be running and you can view the API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Step 5: Test the API
The FastAPI application includes a Swagger UI that allows you to test the various endpoints. The following endpoints are available:

| Endpoint  | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /pets     | Returns custom pet care advice based on the input message.                                    |
| /blog     | Generates a first draft of a research blog post including embedded links.                     |
| /customer | Provides customer service answers, adapting to open and closing hours.                        |
| /twitter  | Returns details about Twitter users and sends emails using hunter.io API.                     |
| /test     | A test route to check the integration of the Toolhouse SDK.                                   |


### Understanding Toolhouse SDK
Toolhouse acts as an orchestration layer between the GPT model and various tools. The integration uses the Toolhouse SDK, which enables actions to be taken based on AI decisions. For instance, the AI can be instructed to send emails or retrieve customer support information.

### Project Structure
app.py: This is the main file that sets up the FastAPI app, configures middleware, defines routes, and integrates Toolhouse with OpenAI's GPT models.
SystemPrompts.py: This file contains pre-configured system prompts that are passed into the API to shape the behavior of each endpoint.
demo.html: This file contains an example of the rag and search tools on a web page

## How Toolhouse helps
Today's LLM technology doesn't run any code itself. Instead, you can run code externally: Toolhouse runs the code through the tool chosen by the LLM and on behalf the LLM. Once the tool has run it then tells the LLM what the output was.

Writing good tools is a long and time-consuming exercise which requires a lot of efforts. You have to write definitions of inputs and outputs, robust error handling, handle the infrastructure to host the tool and most importantly effective communication with the model. Every model implements function calling slightly differently. This causes challenges in schema design, logic implementation, and interaction management.

### âœ¨ Using Toolhouse -
You can use tools that have been written and maintained by developers like you. These tools work with any LLM that supports tool use. As most developers use more than one LLM provider in their deployments, Toolhouse is designed to help you manage your functions across each model.
